# Function to plot the results of a fitted Stan model -------------------------#
# against the data to which it was fit  ---------------------------------------# 


# Input:

# - stan_fit: model fit results, user defined (class = stanfit).
# - variable_model: name of the model variable to plot, user defined (class = character)
# - variable_data: name of the data variable to plot, user defined (class = character). 
# - data: observed or simulated data which the model was fit to, user defined
#   (class = data.frame). 

# Output: 

# - ggplot of the model fit
